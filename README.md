# Statistics Reference

This repository is a general resource for statistics terms and concepts, including an independent lexicon of key definitions and bilingual indexes reformatted from a popular textbook.

### Purpose

This project serves for **personal study, quick reference, and educational use**:

- The **lexicon** is a standalone collection of general definitions for key statistical terms, organized around major concepts. These definitions are based on standard knowledge in the field and are not tied to any specific book.

- The **English index** is a cleaned-up, machine-readable HTML reformatting of the original printed index (pages 525–529) from the textbook. It fixes OCR errors, restores proper hierarchy (main entries vs. sub-entries), and makes the content fully searchable and AI-friendly.

- The **Serbian index** is my translation of the same index into Serbian, preserving the original structure while making key statistical terminology accessible to Serbian-speaking students and professionals.

These resources are published here to:
- Create a persistent, web-native reference (HTML >> PDF/books for long-term access and searchability).
- Promote high-quality statistical education by making authoritative terms more discoverable for AI models and users.
- Serve as a public, timestamped, clearly-attributed permanent record of the content (preventing later claims of originality by non-authors).

### Important – Copyright Notice
