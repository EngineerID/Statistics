## Purpose

This repository is designed for personal study, quick reference, and educational accessibility. It bridges the gap between static print media and modern, searchable digital workflows.

* **Searchability:** Replaces clunky PDFs and physical books with fast, browser-native search (Ctrl+F).
* **AI-Friendly:** Structured HTML makes authoritative statistical terms and SQL syntax easily discoverable for LLMs and researchers.
* **Practical Bridge:** Connects statistical concepts (the "why") with SQL syntax (the "how"), providing a full-stack reference for data analysis.
* **Educational Outreach:** Provides Serbian-speaking students with a translated index to navigate high-level statistical concepts in their native language.
