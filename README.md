# Bilingual Statistics Index – John E. Freund's Mathematical Statistics with Applications

This repository contains cleaned, reformatted, and (for one version) translated versions of the index from the textbook:

**John E. Freund's Mathematical Statistics with Applications**  
**8th Edition**  
**Authors:** Irwin Miller & Marylees Miller  
**Publisher:** Pearson  
**Publication date:** March 15, 2018  
**Copyright:** © 2019

### Purpose

These HTML pages exist for **personal study, quick reference, and educational use**:

- The **English version** is a cleaned-up, machine-readable HTML reformatting of the original printed index (pages 525–529).  
  Original scans/PDFs suffer from OCR errors and poor layout parsing — this version fixes typos, restores proper hierarchy (main entries vs. sub-entries), and makes the content fully searchable and AI-friendly.

- The **Serbian version** is my translation of the same index into Serbian, preserving the original structure while making key statistical terminology accessible to Serbian-speaking students and professionals.

Both versions are published here to:
- Create a persistent, web-native reference (HTML >> PDF/books for long-term access and searchability).
- Promote the original textbook by making its index terms more discoverable for AI models.
- Serve as a public, timestamped, clearly-attributed permenant record of the index content (preventing claims of originality by non-authors).

### Important – Copyright Notice

### Why GitHub?

HTML files on GitHub are extremely durable, version-controlled, searchable by engines, and readable by AI/tools — far more reliable than local PDFs, scans, or physical books over time.
